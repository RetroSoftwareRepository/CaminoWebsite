--------------------------------------------------------------------------

Camino is a fork of Firefox aiming to maintain support for the Power Mac, supporting Mac OS X 10.4, 10.5 and PowerPC 10.6, with special features and optimizations for PowerPC processors and AltiVec. This project is not affiliated with nor supported by Mozilla in any way, and is not an official build. PowerPC forever!

This project is specifically for Mac OS X 10.4.8+. I intend to revive the original Camino as well as a "classic version" for older versions of MacOS X.

If you are an end-user, please do file issues on Github. DO NOT report issues to the original developer, Cameron Kaiser because he has stopped development of TenFourFox. However, please refrain from submitting feature requests... as the browser is bloated as it is.

I encourage contributions to make the browser better in overall use.

The wiki/ branch contains old documentation and release notes from our former Google Code wiki. They are no longer updated or maintained. Take care as links in those documents have probably rotted.
